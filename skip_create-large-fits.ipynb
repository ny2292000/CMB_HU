        "However, a 40000 x 40000 array of doubles is nearly twelve gigabytes! Most\nsystems won't be able to create that in memory just to write out to disk. In\norder to create such a large file efficiently requires a little extra work,\nand a few assumptions.\n\nFirst, it is helpful to anticipate about how large (as in, how many keywords)\nthe header will have in it. FITS headers must be written in 2880 byte\nblocks, large enough for 36 keywords per block (including the END keyword in\nthe final block). Typical headers have somewhere between 1 and 4 blocks,\nthough sometimes more.\n\nSince the first thing we write to a FITS file is the header, we want to write\nenough header blocks so that there is plenty of padding in which to add new\nkeywords without having to resize the whole file. Say you want the header to\nuse 4 blocks by default. Then, excluding the END card which Astropy will add\nautomatically, create the header and pad it out to 36 * 4 cards.\n\nCreate a stub array to initialize the HDU; its\nexact size is irrelevant, as long as it has the desired number of\ndimensions\n\n"
